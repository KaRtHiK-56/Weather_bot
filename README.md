# Weather_bot
This is a Weather API chatbot, which will tell you about the current weather and it is built using the RASA framework.

I started this project to get familiar with developing chatbots, since the RASA Framework was open source i opted for it.



## Introduction to RASA 
Please refer to the blog where I have explained the basics of how to get started with the RASA Framework.

## Working of the bot
**Project Explanation: Weather API Chatbot using RASA Framework**
The Link for the demo is given in the DEMO section.

**1. Why Weather API Chatbot:**

   The Weather API chatbot serves as a convenient and user-friendly tool for retrieving real-time weather information. It leverages the RASA Framework to create a natural language interface, allowing users to inquire about weather conditions in a conversational manner. This project is particularly useful for individuals who want quick and accurate weather updates without needing to navigate complex interfaces.

**2. Developing NLU and Stories:**

   - **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** The NLU component involves training the chatbot to understand user inputs. Using RASA's NLU capabilities, the model is trained on a dataset that includes examples of user queries related to weather conditions (e.g., "What's the weather like today?", "Tell me the temperature in New York"). This enables the bot to comprehend and extract relevant information from user messages.
   
   - **Stories:** Stories represent conversational flows or dialogues between users and the chatbot. In the context of a weather API chatbot, stories define the paths a conversation can take. These stories are created to cover various scenarios, ensuring the chatbot can handle diverse interactions.

Example:

User: Hi/Hello

Bot: The bot will greet the user with Good Morning/Good Afternoon/Good Evening based on the current time, followed by "Welcome I am a weather bot", and "How can I help you?"

User: 
what is the weather in location / what is the weather now?

           - there are 2 situations involved here.
           
           1. the user will directly ask for the weather along with the location mentioned.
           
           2. the user will ask only for the weather without mentioning the location.	

Bot:       

           1. the bot will collect the location from the text, hit the API, and fetch the weather for the location.

           2. if the location is not mentioned the bot will ask  for the location, hit the API, and fetch the weather for the location.
           
Bot:  Did that help you?

User: Yes/No.

Bot: 1. Yes - Thanks for the feedback. 

Bot: 2. No- Sorry to hear from you. This feedback is noted for improvement.

User: Bye

Bot: Bye, we can catch up after some time. 

The bot is also trained in a few more situations where,

If any gibberish words or questions are asked it will respond that: sorry couldn't understand you can you please come again

If any out-of-context questions are asked it will respond that: this is out of my scope of work.


**3. Getting API from OpenWeather:**
   - **OpenWeather API:** To provide accurate and up-to-date weather information, the chatbot integrates with the OpenWeather API.

   - **API Integration:** RASA's custom actions can be implemented to handle API calls. These actions trigger the communication with the OpenWeather API, retrieve the weather data, and format it for user-friendly responses. The API key is securely stored and utilized to authenticate each request, ensuring the chatbot has access to the necessary weather information.

**4. Uses of the Chatbot:**

   - **Weather Updates:** Users can inquire about current weather conditions, forecasts, and other relevant details for specific locations.
     
   - **Conversational Interaction:** The chatbot provides a conversational interface, allowing users to interact with the weather service naturally.
     
   - **User Engagement:** Enhances user engagement by providing information quickly and interactively.
     
   - **Accessibility:** Enables users to access weather information without complex navigation in weather applications.

**5. Conclusion:**

   The Weather API chatbot using the RASA Framework offers a seamless and user-friendly experience for obtaining weather information. By integrating with the OpenWeather API, the chatbot ensures accurate and timely responses. The project showcases the potential of natural language processing in creating practical and accessible solutions. It serves as a foundation for expanding conversational AI applications into various domains, making information retrieval more intuitive and engaging for users.
